        <title>Welcome to Jekyll!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;Tom&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &#39;Hi, Tom&#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home&quot;&gt;Jekyll docs&lt;/a&gt; for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll’s GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;.

        <title>Replicated - An Easier Path from SaaS to Enterprise</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;replicated---an-easier-path-from-saas-to-enterprise&quot;&gt;Replicated - An Easier Path from SaaS to Enterprise&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;19 Jun 2015 - San Francisco&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last year I’ve had a chance to learn a lot more about early stage
funding and made angel investments in a handful of startups. So far I’ve
restricted my involvement to companies with ideas in which I have significant
domain knowledge. I also insist on founders with relentless product focus, a
fierce desire to help their customers be more awesome, and excellent
communication skills. I recently met just such a company, with just such
founders, tackling a problem that has personally caused me much pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company is &lt;a href=&quot;http://replicated.com&quot;&gt;Replicated&lt;/a&gt;, and founders Grant Miller
and Marc Campbell are making it easier to roll out an on-prem Enterprise
offering based on an existing cloud-based SaaS product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At GitHub, we burned through &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt; of developer cycles building our own
installer (several times), securing the installation environment, coding an
automated licensing management system, integrating single sign-on services
(LDAP, Active Directory, CAS, etc, etc), building out a searchable audit system,
supporting customer-reviewable support bundles (logs and other diagnostic
output), allowing numerous backup strategies, and countless other
Enterprise-specific features that were killing our Enterprise deals. All of this
on top of hiring and building out the necessary sales, support, and accounting
teams to create a smooth Enterprise experience for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replicated provides common Enterprise functionality (much of what I mentioned
above, and all of it eventually) that you can wrap around your SaaS product,
resulting in a first-class on-prem product in a fraction of the time. Beyond
just technology, Replicated will help you understand your Enterprise customers
through documentation on best practices and insight into the requirements and
reasons that large companies desire the features they do. Until you can
empathise with your customer (which is very hard to do as a fast-moving SaaS
startup), you’ll never build the best product possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting into the Enterprise market will always be hard. But by reducing the
technology burden, Replicated plans to erase much of the pain so you can focus
on the other human-centric tasks. Not only am I an investor in Replicated, I
believe in their mission and their founders so much that I’ve joined as an
advisor. I understand what the uphill slog of the SaaS to Enterprise climb feels
like, and I’m going to do my best to ensure you don’t have to suffer it as much
as I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also pleased to announce that Travis CI is now shipping their Enterprise
product using Replicated. To see what the installation process is like, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViN-qkcovL0&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;watch
Grant install Travis CI
Enterprise&lt;/a&gt; on a
fresh server in about seven minutes. For a deeper dive, Travis CI has also
published a blog post covering some of their process in &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.travis-ci.com/2015-06-19-how-we-improved-travis-ci-installation/&quot;&gt;getting their
Enterprise installer ready using
Replicated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see other well-known startups launching (or
re-launching) Enterprise versions of their SaaS software on top of Replicated.
If you’re looking to do the same, and want to save yourself a lot of heartache,
email &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#110;&amp;#116;&amp;#097;&amp;#099;&amp;#116;&amp;#064;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#112;&amp;#108;&amp;#105;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;&amp;#100;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&quot;&gt;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#110;&amp;#116;&amp;#097;&amp;#099;&amp;#116;&amp;#064;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#112;&amp;#108;&amp;#105;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;&amp;#100;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&lt;/a&gt;, and start
focusing on what matters the most: your unique and kickass product.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Farewell GitHub, Hello Immersive Computing</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;farewell-github-hello-immersive-computing&quot;&gt;Farewell GitHub, Hello Immersive Computing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;21 Apr 2014 - New York City&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is my last day at GitHub. Recent events have given me a lot of time to
reflect on what’s important to me, and I’ve decided to switch gears and focus on
building something from scratch again. Since visiting the Oculus VR team at
their office three months ago, I’ve come to believe that immersive computing
(aka virtual reality) is poised to rival the personal computer, the web, social
networking, and mobile devices in its impact. While the timing is more abrupt
than I had intended, with everything that’s happened, I think now is the right
time to do this, and I’d like to explain why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I want to address the serious accusations that were made against me and
my family over the past month. With every decision I made at GitHub and in every
interaction I had with employees, I tried to treat people better than they
expected and to resolve conflict with empathy. Despite that, I’ve made mistakes,
and I am deeply sorry to anyone who was hurt by those mistakes. It devastates me
to know that I missed the mark, and I will strive to do better, every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I want to be very clear about one thing: neither my wife, Theresa,
nor I have ever engaged in gender-based harassment or discrimination. The
results of GitHub’s independent investigation unequivocally confirm this and we
are prepared to fight any further false claims on this matter to the full extent
of the law. I believe in diversity and equality for all people in all
professions, especially the tech sector. It’s immensely important to me and I
will continue to do my very best to further that belief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the investigation and all the attention surrounding it have me
concerned that remaining at GitHub would be a distraction for both me and the
company. I’m incredibly proud of what I’ve helped build at GitHub and I don’t
want the events of the past month to jeopardize that. I care too much about the
company and the people here to let that happen. The GitHub team is incredibly
strong, with fierce vision, and I have no doubt they will continue to
revolutionize software development for decades to come. Founding and building
GitHub has been the greatest adventure of my life. I’ve been so lucky to be on
this journey with such amazing, helpful, talented, and real people. I’m going to
miss working with such a great team, but I’m also insanely excited about the
future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the early days of GitHub, I’ve wanted to create a different kind of
business. One that was &lt;a href=&quot;http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/10/18/optimize-for-happiness.html&quot;&gt;Optimized for
Happiness&lt;/a&gt;
and built atop a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0FzgvYxdvk&quot;&gt;Framework of
Happiness&lt;/a&gt;. One where great people
could work on hard problems together to create unbelievably good products. I
believe I was able to achieve a great deal of success with that model at GitHub,
even if things didn’t always go perfectly according to plan. All of this has
been a tremendous learning experience for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last January I stepped down as CEO and handed that role over to cofounder Chris
Wanstrath so I could focus on future-facing R&amp;amp;D projects with small teams. This
kind of rapid, team-based innovation is what I live for. During my time away
from GitHub I started experimenting with Go, OpenGL, and Unity with an eye
towards the software side of immersive computing. It felt really good to get
back into a code editor and challenge the deeply logical and analytical part of
my brain. I’ve enjoyed the challenges of learning how to lead a company with
hundreds of people, but it’s very hard for me to deny the allure of coding a
system that could once again change the course of history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m telling you this because I think stealth mode is bullshit and if you feel
the same way I do about immersive computing then I want to talk with you about
it. For the next few months I’m going to be living in Manhattan. My wife,
Theresa, is currently participating in Techstars NYC as their very first
nonprofit. Her startup, &lt;a href=&quot;https://omakasecharity.org/&quot;&gt;The Omakase Charity&lt;/a&gt;,
helps donors learn about and support nonprofits that are changing the world with
technology. She’s one of the strongest and most thoughtful women I know, and I’m
hoping to help her succeed with her mission while I’m here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone that reached out to me over the last month, including the
generous team at Andreessen Horowitz. Your support has made a huge difference
and I’m truly excited for what’s next.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Open Source (Almost) Everything</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;open-source-almost-everything&quot;&gt;Open Source (Almost) Everything&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;22 Nov 2011 - San Francisco&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Chris and I first started working on GitHub in late 2007, we split the work into two parts. Chris worked on the Rails app and I worked on Grit, the first ever Git bindings for Ruby. After six months of development, Grit had become complete enough to power GitHub during our public launch of the site and we were faced with an interesting question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should we open source Grit or keep it proprietary?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping it private would provide a higher hurdle for competing Ruby-based Git hosting sites, giving us an advantage. Open sourcing it would mean thousands of people worldwide could use it to build interesting Git tools, creating an even more vibrant Git ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a small amount of debate we decided to open source Grit. I don’t recall the specifics of the conversation but that decision nearly four years ago has led to what I think is one of our most important core values: open source (almost) everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-is-it-awesome-to-open-source-almost-everything&quot;&gt;Why is it awesome to open source (almost) everything?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do it right, open sourcing code is &lt;strong&gt;great advertising&lt;/strong&gt; for you and your company. At GitHub we like to talk publicly about libraries and systems we’ve written that are still closed but destined to become open source. This technique has several advantages. It helps determine what to open source and how much care we should put into a launch. We recently open sourced Hubot, our chat bot, to widespread delight. Within two days it had 500 watchers on GitHub and 409 upvotes on Hacker News. This translates into goodwill for GitHub and more superfans than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your code is popular enough to attract outside contributions, you will have created a &lt;strong&gt;force multiplier&lt;/strong&gt; that helps you get more work done faster and cheaper. More users means more use cases being explored which means more robust code. Our very own &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/defunkt/resque&quot;&gt;resque&lt;/a&gt; has been improved by 115 different individuals outside the company, with hundreds more providing 3rd-party plugins that extend resque’s functionality. Every bug fix and feature that you merge is time saved and customer frustration avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart people like to hang out with other smart people. Smart developers like to hang out with smart code. When you open source useful code, you &lt;strong&gt;attract talent&lt;/strong&gt;. Every time a talented developer cracks open the code to one of your projects, you win. I’ve had many great conversations at tech conferences about my open source code. Some of these encounters have led to ideas that directly resulted in better solutions to problems I was having with my projects. In an industry with such a huge range of creativity and productivity between developers, the right eyeballs on your code can make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re hiring, &lt;strong&gt;the best technical interview possible&lt;/strong&gt; is the one you don’t have to do because the candidate is already kicking ass on one of your open source projects. Once technical excellence has been established in this way, all that remains is to verify cultural fit and convince that person to come work for you. If they’re passionate about the open source code they’ve been writing, and you’re the kind of company that cares about well-crafted code (which clearly you are), that should be simple! We hired &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tanoku&quot;&gt;Vicent Martí&lt;/a&gt; after we saw him doing stellar work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2&quot;&gt;libgit2&lt;/a&gt;, a project we’re spearheading at GitHub to extract core Git functionality into a standalone C library. No technical interview was necessary, Vicent had already proven his skills via open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve hired all those great people through their contributions, dedication to open source code is an amazingly effective way to &lt;strong&gt;retain that talent&lt;/strong&gt;. Let’s face it, great developers can take their pick of jobs right now. These same developers know the value of coding in the open and will want to build up a portfolio of projects they can show off to their friends and potential future employers. That’s right, a paradox! In order to keep a killer developer happy, you have to help them become more attractive to other employers. But that’s ok, because that’s exactly the kind of developer you want to have working for you. So relax and let them work on open source or they’ll go somewhere else where they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I start a new project, I assume it will eventually be open sourced (even if it’s unlikely). This mindset leads to &lt;strong&gt;effortless modularization&lt;/strong&gt;. If you think about how other people outside your company might use your code, you become much less likely to bake in proprietary configuration details or tightly coupled interfaces. This, in turn, leads to cleaner, more maintainable code. Even internal code should pretend to be open source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever written an amazing library or tool at one job and then left to join another company only to rewrite that code or remain miserable in its absence? I have, and it sucks. By getting code out in the public we can drastically &lt;strong&gt;reduce duplication of effort&lt;/strong&gt;. Less duplication means more work towards things that matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, &lt;strong&gt;it’s the right thing to do&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s almost impossible to do anything these days without directly or indirectly executing huge amounts of open source code. If you use the internet, you’re using open source. That code represents millions of man-hours of time that has been spent and then given away so that everyone may benefit. We all enjoy the benefits of open source software, and I believe we are all morally obligated to give back to that community. If software is an ocean, then open source is the rising tide that raises all ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ok-then-what-shouldnt-i-open-source&quot;&gt;Ok, then what shouldn’t I open source?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s easy. Don’t open source anything that represents core business value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of what we don’t open source and why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Core GitHub Rails app (easier to sell when closed)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Jobs Sinatra app (specially crafted integration with github.com)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of things we do open source and why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grit (general purpose Git bindings, useful for building many tools)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ernie (general purpose BERT-RPC server)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resque (general purpose job processing)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jekyll (general purpose static site generator)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gollum (general purpose wiki app)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hubot (general purpose chat bot)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Charlock_Holmes (general purpose character encoding detection)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Albino (general purpose syntax highlighting)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Linguist (general purpose filetype detection)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that everything we keep closed has specific business value that could be compromised by giving it away to our competitors. Everything we open is a general purpose tool that can be used by all kinds of people and companies to build all kinds of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-one-true-license&quot;&gt;What is the One True License?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer the MIT license and almost everything we open source at GitHub carries this license. I love this license for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s short. Anyone can read this license and understand exactly what it means without wasting a bunch of money consulting high-octane lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enough protection is offered to be relatively sure you won’t sue me if something goes wrong when you use my code.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everyone understands the legal implications of the MIT license. Weird licenses like the WTFPL and the Beer license pretend to be the “ultimate in free licenses” but utterly fail at this goal. These fringe licenses are too vague and unenforceable to be acceptable for use in some companies. On the other side, the GPL is too restrictive and dogmatic to be usable in many cases. I want everyone to benefit from my code. Everyone. That’s what Open should mean, and that’s what Free should mean.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rad-how-do-i-get-started&quot;&gt;Rad, how do I get started?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy, just flip that switch on your GitHub repository from private to public and tell the world about your software via your blog, Twitter, Hacker News, and over beers at your local pub. Then sit back, relax, and enjoy being part of something big.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rejected Bio from The Setup</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;rejected-bio-from-the-setup&quot;&gt;Rejected Bio from The Setup&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;03 May 2011 - San Francisco&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tom.preston-werner.usesthis.com/&quot;&gt;the autobiographical post I wrote for The
Setup&lt;/a&gt; went live. I wrote that post
over a year ago and then entered into an epic battle with
&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/waferbaby&quot;&gt;@waferbaby&lt;/a&gt; about the length of my “Who are
you, and what do you do?” section. He said it was too long. I said it could
not be shortened. And so the post sat for a year, collecting dust, neither of
us prepared to back down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a month ago I decided that it was foolish to let the words I had written rot on my hard drive and so I did the only thing I knew how to do: overreact. So I cut the original nine-hundred words of my bio down to fourteen words and resubmitted it to Daniel. Those are the words you see in the post now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your pleasure, here is the original bio in its full, unabridged glory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Tom Preston-Werner. I find that the hyphenated last name
makes me sound distinguished and worth listening to. I grew up three
decades ago in a small city in Iowa along the Mississippi, which means
I shucked a lot of corn and know exactly how many mosquitos will land
on your arm should you hold it still for ten minutes at dusk on the
muggiest day of the summer. As an aspiring theoretical particle
physicist, I worked my way through entire shelves of scientific
literature from the public library, desperately wanting to understand
the bewildering mathematics that littered the pages like so many
leaves on the bottom of that morning’s cup of green tea. I searched in
vain for instructors or classmates that could provide me with the
insight necessary to comprehend the true meaning of Heisenberg’s
Uncertainty Principle, but all I found were underpaid math teachers
and disillusioned “students” in search of their next smoke break.
After obsessing over US News’ Best Colleges reports for months I
finally chose and was accepted to Harvey Mudd, a tiny engineering
school in California famous for assigning the greatest number of hours
of homework per night. This sounded just perfect to me. Finally a
place I could bring up the EPR Paradox and not be immediately
stigmatized as “that science weirdo with the hilariously thick glasses
and unfortunate hairdo.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mudd did not disappoint. But now I had the opposite problem. In order
to properly understand particle physics, you must have a deep and
profound love of math. You have to be so comfortable with abstract
concepts that even Picasso would be jealous. Ironically, in order to
grasp the fundamental reality of our universe, you must forget about
the “reality” of everyday life and start living in a world comprised
of eigenvectors, Hilbert spaces, and Planck’s constant. This was a
leap I could not make. I like math, but I’m too easily distracted by
macroscopic reality to make it my profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I accepted that I would never spend late nights poring over
bubble chamber printouts at Fermilab, it became obvious that I was
destined to enter computer science. I started programming in BASIC on
a TRS-80 that my dad bought from Radio Shack when I was 8 years old.
Since then, I’d learned to love the discipline and creativity involved
in making a machine do my bidding. It was like having a super-obedient
but annoyingly logical little brother. He’ll do anything you want as
long as you tell him in precise and unambiguous language. The best
thing is, the feedback is immediate. In physics, it can take twenty
years to prove that a single esoteric particle even exists. When
you’re writing a program that displays the number of electrons in each
of the shells around the nucleus of every element, the feedback is
immediate and intoxicating. With just a few keystrokes, the world is
changed forever. Try to get that kind of rush even once in a lifetime
as a theoretical particle physicist. I dare you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1999, after two years of college, I dropped out of Harvey Mudd to
join a startup with some friends that were graduating. It was the end
of the first dot-com bubble and I thought I could strike it rich,
right then and there. Sadly, like so many startups of the day, we
never accomplished what we envisioned and I ended up bouncing between
jobs and consulting gigs for six years until I found myself in San
Francisco. If Harvey Mudd was my mecca for physicists, then San
Francisco was my mecca for programmers. Where else can you be grabbing
lunch at a taqueria and overhear a group at the next table discussing
the finer points of optimizing C code to run on an embedded processor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I moved to San Francisco to take a job as a Ruby developer with a
Wikipedia search engine called Powerset. I also began attending Ruby
meetups and drinking with local software developers. There are a lot
of talented people in the Bay Area and I wanted to meet them all.
Within the Ruby community, a distributed version control system called
Git was starting to get some attention. It was a really cool way of
working with other people on code, but there wasn’t an easy way to get
up and running with a group of developers. Along with cofounders Chris
Wanstrath and PJ Hyett (who I met at the Ruby meetups) I started a
company called GitHub that would address this problem and make it dead
simple to share Git repositories and collaborate on code with other
developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, we worked on GitHub on the side, putting in time on evenings
and weekends. After six months we launched the site to the public and
started charging. Not long after that, Powerset was acquired by
Microsoft and I was faced with a choice: stay on as a Microsoft
employee with a big retention bonus and give up GitHub or turn down
the Microsoft money and quit Powerset to work on GitHub full-time. You
can read more about this saga in my blog post entitled &lt;a href=&quot;http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/10/18/how-i-turned-down-300k.html&quot;&gt;How I Turned
Down $300,000 from Microsoft to go Full-Time on
GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.
I think I made the right decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today GitHub has twenty-nine employees and more than 730,000 users with over
2,000,000 repositories. We’re growing fast, and I’m having the time of
my life!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>h1. Ten Lessons from GitHub&#39;s First Year

p(meta). 29 Mar 2011 / 29 Dec 2008 - San Francisco

&lt;b&gt;NOTE: This post was written in late December of 2008, more than two years ago. It has stayed in my drafts folder since then, waiting for the last 2% to be written. Why I never published it is beyond my reckoning, but it serves as a great reminder of how I perceived the world back then. In the time since I wrote this we&#39;ve grown from four people to twenty-six, settled into an office, installed a kegerator, and still never taken outside funding. In some ways, things have changed a great deal, but in the most important ways, things are still exactly the same. Realizing this puts a big smile on my face.&lt;/b&gt;

The end of the year is a great time to sit down with a glass of your favorite beverage, dim the lights, snuggle up next to the fire and think about what you&#39;ve learned over the past twelve months.

For me, 2008 was the year that I helped design, develop, and launch GitHub. Creating a new startup is an intense learning experience. Through screwups and triumphs, I have learned some valuable lessons this year. Here&#39;s a few of them.

h2. Start Early

When Chris and I started working on GitHub in late 2007, Git was largely unknown as a version control system. Sure, Linux kernel hackers had been using it since day one, but outside of that small microcosm, it was rare to come across a developer that was using it on a day-to-day basis. I was first introduced to Git by Dave Fayram, a good friend and former coworker during my days at Powerset. Dave is the quintessential early adopter and, as far as I can calculate, patient zero for the spread of Git adoption in the Ruby community and beyond.

Back then, the Git landscape was pretty barren. Git had only recently become  usable by normal people with the 1.5 release. As for Git hosting, there was really only &quot;repo.or.cz&quot;:http://repo.or.cz/, which felt to me very limited, clumsy, and poorly designed. There were no commercial Git hosting options whatsoever. Despite this, people were starting to talk about Git at the Ruby meetups. About how awesome it was. But something was amiss. Git was supposed to be this amazing way to work on code in a distributed way, but what was the mechanism to securely share private code? Your only option was to setup user accounts on Unix machines and use that as an ad-hoc solution. Not ideal.

And so GitHub was born. But it was born into a world where there was no existing market for paid Git hosting. We would be _creating_ the market. I vividly remember telling people, &quot;I don&#39;t expect GitHub to succeed right away. Git adoption will take a while, but we&#39;ll be ready when it happens.&quot; Neither Chris nor I were in any particular hurry for this to happen. I was working full time at Powerset, and he was making good money as a Rails consultant. By choosing to build early on top of a nascent technology, we were able to construct a startup with basically no overhead, no competition, and in our free time.

h2. Adapt to Your Customers

Here&#39;s a seemingly paradoxical piece of advice for you: Listen to your customers, but don&#39;t let them tell you what to do. Let me explain. Consider a feature request such as &quot;GitHub should let me FTP up a documentation site for my project.&quot; What this customer is really trying to say is &quot;I want a simple way to publish content related to my project,&quot; but they&#39;re used to what&#39;s already out there, and so they pose the request in terms that are familiar to them. We could have implemented some horrible FTP based solution as requested, but we looked deeper into the underlying question and now we allow you to publish content by simply pushing a Git repository to your account. This meets requirements of both functionality _and_ elegance.

Another company that understands this concept at a fundamental level is Apple. I&#39;m sure plenty of people asked Apple to make a phone but Steve Jobs and his posse looked beneath the request and figured out what people really wanted: a nice looking, simple to use, and easy to sync mobile device that kicked some serious ass. And that&#39;s the secret. Don&#39;t give your customers what they ask for; give them what they _want_.

h2. Have Fun

I went to college at a little school in California called Harvey Mudd. Yeah, I know you haven&#39;t heard of it, but if you remember those US News &amp; World Report &quot;Best Colleges&quot; books that you obsessed over in highschool (ok, maybe you didn&#39;t, but I did), Harvey Mudd was generally ranked as the engineering school with the greatest number of hours of homework per night. Yes, more than MIT, and yes, more than Caltech. It turned out to be true, as far as I can tell. I have fond memories of freaking out about ridiculously complex spring/mass/damper systems and figuring the magnetic flux of a wire wrapped around a cylinder in a double helix. We studied hard--very hard. But we played hard too. It was the only thing that could possibly keep us sane.

Working on a startup is like that. It feels a bit like college. You&#39;re working on insanely hard projects, but you&#39;re doing it with your best friends in the world and you&#39;re having a great time (usually). In both environments, you have to goof off a lot in order to balance things out. Burnout is a real and dangerous phenomenon. Fostering a playful and creative environment is critical to maintaining both your personal health, and the health (and idea output) of the company.

h2. Pay attention to Twitter

I&#39;ve found Twitter to be an extremely valuable resource for instant feedback. If the site is slow for some reason, Twitter will tell me so. If the site is unreachable for people in a certain country (I&#39;m looking at you China), I&#39;ll find out via Twitter. If that new feature we just released is really awesome, I&#39;ll get a nice ego boost by scanning the Twitter search.

People have a tendency to turn to Twitter to bitch about all the little bugs they see on your website, usually appended with the very tiresome &quot;FAIL&quot;. These are irksome to read, but added together are worth noticing. Often times these innocent tweets will inform a decision about whether an esoteric bug is worth adding to the short list. We also created a GitHub account on Twitter that our support guy uses to respond to negative tweets. Offering this level of customer service almost always turns a disgruntled customer into a happy one.

If you have an iPhone, I heartily recommend the &quot;Summizer&quot;:http://fanzter.com/products/download/summizer app from Fanzter, Inc. It makes searching, viewing, and responding to tweets a cinch.

h2. Deploy at Will!

At the first RailsConf I had the pleasure of hearing Martin Fowler deliver an amazing keynote. He made some apt metaphors regarding agile development that I will now paraphrase and mangle.

Imagine you&#39;re tasked with building a computer controlled gun that can accurately hit a target about 50 meters distant. That is the only requirement. One way to do this is to build a complex machine that measures every possible variable (wind, elevation, temperature, etc.) before the shot and then takes aim and shoots. Another approach is to build a simple machine that fires rapidly and can detect where each shot hits. It then uses this information to adjust the aim of the next shot, quickly homing in on the target a little at a time.

The difference between these two approaches is to realize that bullets are cheap. By the time the former group has perfected their wind detection instrument, you&#39;ll have finished your simple weapon and already hit the target.

In the world of web development, the target is your ideal offering, the bullets are your site deploys, and your customers provide the feedback mechanism. The first year of a web offering is a magical one. Your customers are most likely early adopters and love to see new features roll out every few weeks. If this results in a little bit of downtime, they&#39;ll easily forgive you, as long as those features are sweet. In the early days of GitHub, we&#39;d deploy up to ten times in one afternoon, always inching closer to that target.

Make good use of that first year, because once the big important customers start rolling in, you have to be a lot more careful about hitting one of them with a stray bullet. Later in the game, downtime and botched deploys are money lost and you have to rely more on building instruments to predict where you should aim.

h2. You Don&#39;t Need an Office

All four fulltime GitHub employees work in the San Francisco area, and yet we have no office. But we&#39;re not totally virtual either. In fact, a couple times a week you&#39;ll find us at a cafe in North Beach, huddled around a square table that was made by nailing 2x4s to an ancient fold-out bulletin board. It&#39;s no Google campus, but the rent is a hell of a lot cheaper and the drinks are just as good!

This is not to say that we haven&#39;t looked at a few places to call home. Hell, we almost leased an old bar. But in the end there&#39;s no hurry to settle down. We&#39;re going to wait until we find the perfect office. Until then, we can invest the savings back into the company, or into our pockets. For now, I like my couch and the cafe just fine.

Of course, none of this would be possible without 37signals&#39; &quot;Campfire&quot;:http://www.campfirenow.com/ web-based chat and the very-difficult-to-find-but-totally-amazing &quot;Propane&quot;:http://productblog.37signals.com/products/2008/10/propane-takes-c.html OSX desktop app container that doubles the awesome. Both highly recommended.

h2. Hire Through Open Source

Beyond the three cofounders of GitHub, we&#39;ve hired one full time developer (Scott Chacon) and one part time support specialist (Tekkub).

We hired Tekkub because he was one of the earliest GitHub users and actively maintains more than 75 projects (WoW addons mostly) on GitHub and was very active in sending us feedback in the early days. He would even help people out in the IRC channel, simply because he enjoyed doing so.

I met Scott at one of the San Francisco Ruby meetups where he was presenting on one of his myriad Git-centric projects. Scott had been working with Git long before anyone else in the room. He was also working on a pure Ruby implementation of Git at the same time I was working on my fork/exec based Git bindings. It was clear to me then that depending on how things went down, he could become either a powerful ally or a dangerous foe. Luckily, we all went drinking afterwards and we became friends. Not long after, Scott started consulting for us and wrote the entire backend for what you now know of as &quot;Gist&quot;:http://gist.github.com/. We knew then that we would do whatever it took to hire Scott full time. There would be no need for an interview or references. We already knew everything we needed to know in order to make him an offer without the slightest reservation.

The lesson here is that it&#39;s far easier and less risky to hire based on relevant past performance than it is to hire based on projected future performance. There&#39;s a corollary that also comes into play: if you&#39;re looking to work for a startup (or anyone for that matter), contribute to the community that surrounds it. Use your time and your code to prove that you&#39;re the best one for the job.

h2. Trust your Team

There&#39;s nothing I hate more than micromanagers. When I was doing graphic design consulting 5 years ago I had a client that was very near the Platonic form of a micromanager. He insisted that I travel to his office where I would sit in the back room at an old Mac and design labels and catalogs and touch up photographs of swimwear models (that part was not so bad!). While I did these tasks he would hover over me and bark instructions. &quot;Too red! Can you make that text smaller? Get rid of those blemishes right there!&quot; It drove me absolutely batty.

This client could have just as easily given me the task at the beginning of the day, gone and run the business, and come back in 6 hours whereupon I would have created better designs twice as fast as if he were treating me like a robot that converted his speech into Photoshop manipulations. By treating me this way, he was marginalizing my design skills and wasting both money and talent.

Micromanagement is symptomatic of a lack of trust. The remedy for this ailment is to hire experts and then trust their judgment. In a startup, you can drastically reduce momentum by applying micromanagement, or you can boost momentum by giving trust. It&#39;s pretty amazing what can happen when a group of talented people who trust each other get together and decide to make something awesome.

h2. You Don&#39;t Need Venture Capital

A lot has been written recently about how the venture capital world is changing. I don&#39;t pretend to be an expert on the subject, but I&#39;ve learned enough to say that a web startup like ours doesn&#39;t need any outside money to succeed. I know this because we haven&#39;t taken a single dime from investors. We bootstrapped the company on a few thousand dollars and became profitable the day we opened to the public and started charging for subscriptions.

In the end, every startup is different, and the only person that can decide if outside money makes sense is you. There are a million things that could drive you to seek and accept investment, but you should make sure that doing so is in your best interest, because it&#39;s quite possible that you don&#39;t _need_ to do so. One of the reasons I left my last job was so that I could say &quot;the buck stops here.&quot; If we&#39;d taken money, I would no longer be able to say that.

h2. Open Source Whatever You Can

In order for GitHub to talk to Git repositories, I created the first ever Ruby Git bindings. Eventually, this library become quite complete and we were faced with a choice: Do we open source it or keep it to ourselves? Both approaches have benefits and drawbacks. Keeping it private means that the hurdle for competing Ruby-based Git hosting sites would be higher, giving us an advantage. But open sourcing it would mean that

&lt;b&gt;NOTE: This is where the post ended and remained frozen in carbonite until today. I intend to write a follow up post on our open source philosophy at GitHub in the near future. I&#39;m sure the suspense is killing you!&lt;/b&gt;

        <title>Designer, Architect, Developer</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;designer-architect-developer&quot;&gt;Designer, Architect, Developer&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;11 Dec 2010 - San Francisco&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last six years I’ve bootstrapped three successful enterprises (Cube6 Media, Gravatar, and GitHub) and failed to gain traction with a handful of others. After a lot of thought and reflections on these experiences, I’ve identified three major skills that should be present in order to best build a successful web application. These roles can be loosely defined as the Designer, the Architect, and the Developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In college I spent a lot of time in the campus dark room dipping rolls of film and sheets of paper into various chemical baths beneath a dim red light. The most interesting part, though, was mounting the negative into the projector and exposing the photo paper. Every time I turned on the bright light of the projector I was reminded of a saying that has stuck with me ever since: “A photograph is nothing more than an image created by light.” Think about that for a second. The only way the photograph, and hence, the viewer, interact with the original subject is via the light that was captured. None of the fancy flashes, soft boxes, bounces, umbrellas, or backdrops mean a thing if the light they produce or redirect is in the wrong place. If the light is bad, the photograph is bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the same concept holds true for web applications. Adapting the saying for our own situation, I would say: “A web application is nothing more than an experience created by design.” Users can’t see what technology you use or whether you follow an agile development process or not. All they experience is what’s on the screen. It can’t be confusing, it can’t look amateur, and it can’t have spelling errors. If the UX is bad, the web application is bad. It’s that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way you get good UX is by having a good designer. Someone on the team must be skilled not only in making things pretty, but in making them usable as well. Without a good UX/visual design, you may as well not even bother. It’s impossible to stress how important this is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design comes first. It defines what you will build. Once you have an idea of what you’re creating, you need to figure out how to make it happen. That’s where the Architect comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the recent explosion of open source solutions to common problems like databases, web frameworks, job processors, messaging systems, etc, you need a team member that has a broad understanding of the technology landscape. The choices you make early on will impact your company for many years, and the wrong choices can spell disaster. The role of the Architect is to choose the best tools for the job, and to decide when new tools need to be created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Architect must also be ready to scale any piece of the site when you start attracting users. There’s a fine line between premature optimization and crumbling under the wave of thousands of new signups. A good architect will always be one step ahead of the curve, laying the groundwork for future scaling needs just before they are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design and architecture dictate what you build and how you build it, but without someone to do the construction, you’re dead in the water. The role of the Developer is to turn the wishes of the Designer into reality while staying within the constraints that the Architect has put forth. In addition, the Developer has to ensure that the codebase remains healthy and protect against technical debt. Sloppy development up front means a huge amount of wasted effort later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three roles of the Designer, the Architect, and the Developer may reside in a single person, but it’s much more common to see groups of two or three people satisfy all these skills. In fact, the best founding teams are those where everyone fills some combination of roles. This fosters an environment of friendly argument that leads to better decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But whatever you do, make sure your team fills all of these roles. Once you do, executing on your idea should come easily!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Optimize for Happiness</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;optimize-for-happiness&quot;&gt;Optimize for Happiness&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;18 October 2010 - San Francisco&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two days ago I had the pleasure of speaking at Startup School, a yearly conference on entrepreneurism put on by the great folks at Y Combinator. Never before have I see such a high concentration of smart ambitious people in one place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can watch the recording of my thirty minute slot on Youtube:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/T4VtBcmbbSs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I only had about 25 minutes for the talk and 5 minutes for questions, I wanted to expand upon and clarify some of the ideas I introduced during the talk and then make myself available for additional questions. So today (Monday, 18 October 2010) I’ll be answering any questions you have via Hacker News:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1804443&quot;&gt;Ask me a question on HN!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very first commit to GitHub was made exactly three years ago tomorrow. In that time our team of thirteen has signed up over 420,000 developers and now hosts 1.3 million Git repositories, making us the largest code host on the planet. And we’ve done all of this without ever taking a dime of funding from outside the company. In fact, even within the company we only invested a few thousand dollars out of our own pockets during the first months to cover legal fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the presentation I talk about a choice between optimizing for happiness and optimizing for money. When I say “optimizing for money” I mean following the traditional venture capital route of raising a ton of money to stash in your bank account and going for a huge exit. The unfortunate reality of this approach is that for aspiring entrepreneurs that are not well connected to the VC world, it can take an extraordinary amount of time and effort to raise that money. Even if you are able to raise capital, you are suddenly responsible to your investors and will need to align your interests with theirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world dominated by news about Facebook, Apple, Google, YouTube, Zappos, and other companies heavily funded by venture capital, it’s easy to forget that you can still build a highly profitable business with significant impact on a global market without having to first spend three months on Sand Hill Road asking for permission to build your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure components necessary to run an internet business are finally cheap enough that you can get started without a huge up-front investment. In the months that you would traditionally spend in glass-walled conference rooms you can now build a sophisticated prototype of your product and start getting users signed up and engaging you with useful feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I mean by optimizing for happiness: I’m a hacker; I’m happy when I’m building things of value, not when I’m writing a business plan filled with make believe numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Chris and I started GitHub, I was working full time at Powerset and Chris was doing consulting work and plugging away on a product of his own. GitHub became the leisure activity that I worked on when I got home from the office. I could craft it however I pleased, and there was nobody telling me what to do. This feeling of control and ownership of something you own is intoxicating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within three months we had a simple product and moved into private beta. In six months we launched to the public and started charging for private plans. We’ve been profitable every month since public launch except for one (in which we hired two new employees at once). We did this by making a paycheck via other means until GitHub was generating enough revenue to support us full time at about 2/3 of what we were accustomed to making. We then raised our salaries over the next months when we hit specific revenue goals that allowed us to remain profitable. This happened about one year after inception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A side effect of bootstrapping a sustainable company is what I like to call &lt;b&gt;infinite runway.&lt;/b&gt; This is another element of optimizing for happiness. With venture backed endeavors you generally find that during the first several years the numbers in your bank account are perpetually decreasing, giving your company an expiration date. Your VCs have encouraged you to grow fast and spend hard, which makes perfect sense for them, but not necessary for you. Not if you’re trying to optimize for happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VCs want to see quick success or quick failure. They are optimizing for money. There’s nothing wrong with that as long as you want the same things they do. But if you’re like me, then you care more about building a kickass product than you do about having a ten figure exit. If that’s true, then maybe you should be optimizing for happiness. One way to do this is by bootstrapping a sustainable business with infinite runway. When there are fewer potentially catastrophic events on the horizon, you’ll find yourself smiling a lot more often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ironic thing about bootstrapping and venture capital is that once you demonstrate some success, investors will come to YOU. When this happens you will be in a much better place to make a more reasoned choice about taking on additional capital and all the complexities that come with it. Talking to VCs with some leverage in your back pocket is an entirely different game from throwing yourself in front of a conference table full of general partners and trying to persuade them that you’re worth their time and money. Power is happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other really great things you can do when you optimize for happiness. You can throw away things like financial projections, hard deadlines, ineffective executives that make investors feel safe, and everything that hinders your employees from building amazing products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At GitHub we don’t have meetings. We don’t have set work hours or even work days. We don’t keep track of vacation or sick days. We don’t have managers or an org chart. We don’t have a dress code. We don’t have expense account audits or an HR department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pay our employees well and give them the tools they need to do their jobs as efficiently as possible. We let them decide what they want to work on and what features are best for the customers. We pay for them to attend any conference at which they’ve gotten a speaking slot. If it’s in a foreign country, we pay for another employee to accompany them because traveling alone sucks. We show them the profit and loss statements every month. We expect them to be responsible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We make decisions based on the merits of the arguments, not on who is making them. We strive every day to be better than we were the day before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hold our board meetings in bars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do all this because we’re optimizing for happiness, and because there’s nobody to tell us that we can’t.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Readme Driven Development</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;readme-driven-development&quot;&gt;Readme Driven Development&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;23 August 2010 - San Francisco&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hear a lot of talk these days about TDD and BDD and Extreme Programming and SCRUM and stand up meetings and all kinds of methodologies and techniques for developing better software, but it’s all irrelevant unless the software we’re building meets the needs of those that are using it. Let me put that another way. A perfect implementation of the wrong specification is worthless. By the same principle a beautifully crafted library with no documentation is also damn near worthless. If your software solves the wrong problem or nobody can figure out how to use it, there’s something very bad going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fine. So how do we solve this problem? It’s easier than you think, and it’s important enough to warrant its very own paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write your Readme first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First. As in, before you write any code or tests or behaviors or stories or ANYTHING. I know, I know, we’re programmers, dammit, not tech writers! But that’s where you’re wrong. Writing a Readme is absolutely essential to writing good software. Until you’ve written about your software, you have no idea what you’ll be coding. Between The Great Backlash Against Waterfall Design and The Supreme Acceptance of Agile Development, something was lost. Don’t get me wrong, waterfall design takes things way too far. Huge systems specified in minute detail end up being the WRONG systems specified in minute detail. We were right to strike it down. But what took its place is too far in the other direction. Now we have projects with short, badly written, or entirely missing documentation. Some projects don’t even have a Readme!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not acceptable. There must be some middle ground between reams of technical specifications and no specifications at all. And in fact there is. That middle ground is the humble Readme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to distinguish Readme Driven Development from Documentation Driven Development. RDD could be considered a subset or limited version of DDD. By restricting your design documentation to a single file that is intended to be read as an introduction to your software, RDD keeps you safe from DDD-turned-waterfall syndrome by punishing you for lengthy or overprecise specification. At the same time, it rewards you for keeping libraries small and modularized. These simple reinforcements go a long way towards driving your project in the right direction without a lot of process to ensure you do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By writing your Readme first you give yourself some pretty significant advantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most importantly, you’re giving yourself a chance to think through the project without the overhead of having to change code every time you change your mind about how something should be organized or what should be included in the Public API. Remember that feeling when you first started writing automated code tests and realized that you caught all kinds of errors that would have otherwise snuck into your codebase? That’s the exact same feeling you’ll have if you write the Readme for your project before you write the actual code.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a byproduct of writing a Readme in order to know what you need to implement, you’ll have a very nice piece of documentation sitting in front of you. You’ll also find that it’s much easier to write this document at the beginning of the project when your excitement and motivation are at their highest. Retroactively writing a Readme is an absolute drag, and you’re sure to miss all kinds of important details when you do so.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re working with a team of developers you get even more mileage out of your Readme. If everyone else on the team has access to this information before you’ve completed the project, then they can confidently start work on other projects that will interface with your code. Without any sort of defined interface, you have to code in serial or face reimplementing large portions of code.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a lot simpler to have a discussion based on something written down. It’s easy to talk endlessly and in circles about a problem if nothing is ever put to text. The simple act of writing down a proposed solution means everyone has a concrete idea that can be argued about and iterated upon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the process of writing the Readme for your project as the true act of creation. This is where all your brilliant ideas should be expressed. This document should stand on its own as a testament to your creativity and expressiveness. The Readme should be the single most important document in your codebase; writing it first is the proper thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>TomDoc - Reasonable Ruby Documentation</title>
        <description>h1. TomDoc - Reasonable Ruby Documentation

p(meta). 11 May 2010 - San Francisco

&quot;RDoc&quot;:http://rdoc.rubyforge.org is an abomination. It&#39;s ugly to read in plain text, requires the use of the inane :nodoc: tag to prevent private method documentation from showing up in final rendering, and does nothing to encourage complete or unambiguous documentation of classes, methods, or parameters. &quot;YARD&quot;:http://yardoc.org is much better but goes too far in the other direction (and still doesn&#39;t look good in plain text). Providing an explicit way to specify parameters and types is great, but having to remember a bunch of strict tag names in order to be compliant is not a good way to encourage coders to write documentation. And again we see a @private tag that&#39;s necessary to hide docs from the final render.

Three years ago, after suffering with these existing documentation formats for far too long, I started using my own documentation format. It looked a bit like RDoc but had a set of conventions for specifying parameters, return values, and the expected types. It used plain language and full sentences so that a human could read and understand it without having to parse machine-oriented tags or crufty markup. I called this format TomDoc, because if Linus can name stuff after himself, then why can&#39;t I?

After years in the making, TomDoc is finally a well specified documentation format. You can find the full spec at &quot;http://tomdoc.org&quot;:http://tomdoc.org.

But enough talk. Here&#39;s a sample of what a TomDoc&#39;d method might look like:

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Public: Duplicate some text an abitrary number of times.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# text  - The String to be duplicated.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# count - The Integer number of times to duplicate the text.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Examples&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#   multiplex(&#39;Tom&#39;, 4)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#   # =&amp;gt; &#39;TomTomTomTom&#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Returns the duplicated String.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;multiplex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

At first glance you&#39;ll notice a few things. First, and most important, is that the documentation looks nice in plain text. When I&#39;m working on a project, I need to be able to scan and read method documentation quickly. Littering the docs with tags and markup (especially HTML markup) is not acceptable. Code documentation should be optimized for human consumption. Second, all parameters and return values, and their expected types are specified. Types are generally denoted by class name. Because Ruby is so flexible, you are not constrained by a rigid type declaration syntax and are free to explain precisely how the expected types may vary under different circumstances. Finally, the basic layout is designed to be easy to remember. Once you commit a few simple conventions to memory, writing documentation becomes second nature, with all of the tricky decision making already done for you.

Today&#39;s Ruby libraries suffer deeply from haphazard versioning schemes. Even RubyGems itself does not follow a sane or predictable versioning pattern. This lack of discipline stems from the absence of well defined Public APIs. TomDoc attempts to solve this problem by making it simple to define an unambiguous Public API for your library. Instead of assuming that all classes and methods are intended for public consumption, TomDoc makes the Public API opt-in. To denote that something is public, all you have to do is preface the main description with &quot;Public:&quot;. By forcing you to explicitly state that a class or method is intended for public consumption, a deliberate and thoughtful Public API is automatically constructed that can inform disciplined version changes according to the tenets of &quot;Semantic Versioning&quot;:http://semver.org. In addition, the prominent display of &quot;Public&quot; in a method description ensures that developers are made aware of the sensitive nature of the method and do not carelessly change the signature of something in the Public API.

Once a Public API has been established, some very exciting things become possible. We&#39;re currently working on a processing tool that will render TomDoc into various forms (terminal, HTML, etc). If you run this tool on a library, you&#39;ll get a printout of the Public API documentation. You can publish this online so that others have easy access to it. When you roll a new version of the library, you can run the tool again, giving it a prior version as a base, and have it automatically display only the methods that have changed. This diff will be extremely useful for users while they upgrade to the new version (or so they can evaluate whether an upgrade is warranted)!

While I&#39;ve been using various nascent forms of TomDoc for several years, we&#39;re just now starting to adopt it for everything we do at GitHub. Now that I&#39;ve formalized the spec it will be easy for the entire team to write compliant TomDoc. The goal is to have every class, method, and accessor of every GitHub library documented. In the future, once we have proper tooling, we&#39;d even like to create a unit test that will fail if anything is missing documentation.

TomDoc is still a rough specification so I&#39;m initially releasing it as 0.9.0. Over the coming months I&#39;ll make any necessary changes to address user concerns and release a 1.0.0 version once things have stabilized. If you&#39;d like to suggest changes, please open an issue on the &quot;TomDoc GitHub repository&quot;:http://github.com/mojombo/tomdoc.</description>
